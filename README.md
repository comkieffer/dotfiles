# Dotfiles Repository

## Installation

Download the dotfiles repository:

``` console
$ git clone URL
$ cd dotfiles
```

Install the required dependencies

``` console
$ installers/bootstrap.bash
```

Finally start setting up the system:

``` console
$ ~/local/bin/pyinfra @local installers/install-base-system.py
```

## Tool Setup

### Dotfiles / Dot

The `dot` command is an alias around the `dotfiles` git repository which stores
changes to the home directory. Use it as you would normally use git.

### Fish

Fish is configured to use [fisher](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/fisher) for package management. Run `fisher update` to update the installed plugins.

#### edc/bass

Run `bash` scripts that change the environment and propagate the results to `fish`. It uses a pythoon script to compare the environment before and after the script was run and applies the changes to the `fish` environment.

A simpler version is to run `bash -c script; exec fish`.

#### patrickf1/fzf.fish@v9.7

Fzf.fish is pinned to version `v9.7` because Ubuntu 22.04 only has fish 3.3 and subsequent releases require 3.4.

#### oakninja/makemefish

Makefile browser. Uses `fzf` to show rules in the makefile.

#### gazorby/fish-abbreviation-tips

Show a warning when a command is used instead of an alias/abbreviation in fish.

#### cdo / cdp

Run `cdp-cache-refresh refresh` to refresh the projects cache.

## Manual Configuration

### Sublime Text 3

You must manually enable `PackageControl` in Sublime Text. Open the program and disregard all the error windows that appear for now (mostly missing theme and colour scheme) and press `S-C-P` to open the command palette. Type start typing `package control` and select `Install Package Control` when the option appears.

Package control will start installing all the package in the background. Once its finished, it will have made some changes to the Sublime-Settings (to change the theme away from the previously missing one for example), just revert those and restart Sublime.

## Modern replacements for old tools

- `bat`: better `cat` (better `less` really)
- `exa`: better `ls`
- `rg`: better `grep`
- `fd`: better `find`
- `procs`: better `ps`
- `tokei`: better `cloc`
- `zoxide`: smarter `cd` [GitHub](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide)
