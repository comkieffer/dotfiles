Zq - Quickly jump to a directory

[bold green]$[/bold green] zq dot  [dim]# Open fzf, pre-populated with zoxide query results[/dim]

Zoxide (aliased to the [dim]z[/dim] command) makes it easy to jump to commomly used directories. If it jumps to the wrong directory, run [dim]z dirname[/dim] again to jump to the next most likely directory.

Alternatively, use the [dim]zq[/dim] function to narrow down the list until a single result is left.

For even faster access, use [bold]Alt + Z[/bold] to open [dim]zq[/dim]
